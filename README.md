- Responsive images and image preprocessing pipeline
- Google analytics and tag manager 
- robots.txt generation

## See a live example in our [website](https://theaisummer.com)

The template is based on [theaisummer.com](https://theaisummer.com), which we strip from all the unecessary stuff in order to provide a minimal, ready-to-use but feature-rich framework for scientific blogs.

### Important information

- The template is built with [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) so some familiarity with React is required. For those who want to customize it, we highly recommend to check out the official [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/)
- Typescript and TSX is used instead of Javascript
- The Sass preprocessor is used for styling
- MDX is used instead of Markdown so we can add custom React components inside markdown. That enables us high customizeability, interactive widgets and more.
- Latex is rendered with [Katex](https://katex.org/) and [remark-math](https://github.com/Rokt33r/remark-math)
- Code blocks are rendered with [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer)
- Following Gatsby paradigm, GraphQL is used to query the website content
- Content can also be sourced using YAML files
- Forms can be created using [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- Annimations on scroll support
