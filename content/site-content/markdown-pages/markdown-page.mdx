# Markdown Pages are also supported

Instead of creating the pages with React and JSX, you can instead use typical markdown. That of course limits the UI flexibility but it can be a good and easy alternative.

Simply create an mdx file add to the /site-content/ folder and it will be automatically converted to a page.

All typical markdown commands are supported.

Note that markdown pages won't be considered as posts. Posts are live only in the `posts` folder.

## Code blocks

```python
